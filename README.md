# Image Processing using Verilog HDL

Implemented a Verilog module that takes an image as input and applies various filters on it according to the userâ€™s choice.

## Main steps for doing this project:

1. **Take an image file** (any suitable format).
2. **Convert it to a hexadecimal file**.
3. **Use this hexadecimal file as an input** to the Verilog module.
4. **Select the operation** (Brightness/Invert).
5. **Simulate and obtain the output**.
